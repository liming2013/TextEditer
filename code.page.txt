code.page
output.code.page	 

To support a DBCS language such as Japanese, a code page can be set here. This ensures that double byte characters are always treated as a unit so the caret is never located between the two bytes of a double byte character.

Code page								Value
Default (single byte character set)		0
UTF-8									65001
Japanese Shift-JIS						932
Simplified Chinese GBK					936
Korean Wansung							949
Traditional Chinese Big5				950
Korean Johab							1361

Setting code.page to 65001 starts Unicode mode and the document is treated as a sequence of characters expressed as UTF-8. Display is performed by converting to the platform's normal Unicode encoding first so characters from any language will be displayed. Correct glyphs may only be displayed if fonts are chosen that contain the appropriate glyphs. The Tahoma font contains a wide range of glyphs so may be a good choice. 
This property can not set a single byte character set.
If output.code.page is set then it is used for the output pane which otherwise matches the edit pane.

character.set	 

This setting allows changing the character set that is asked for when setting up fonts. Not all of the values will work on all platforms.

Character set	Value
Default	0
Japanese			128
Chinese GB2312		134
Chinese BIG5		136
Korean				129
Greek				161
Eastern European	238
Baltic				186
Turkish				162
Hebrew				177
Arabic				178
Thai				222
Vietnamese			163
Cyrillic (CP866 on GTK+)						866
Cyrillic (CP1251 on Windows, KOI8-R on GTK+)	204
Cyrillic (CP1251 on GTK+)						1251
European with Euro (ISO 8859-15)				1000

All of these values except for 1251 and 1000 should work on OS X or Windows. On GTK+ Baltic, Turkish, Thai and Vietnamese will probably not work.
